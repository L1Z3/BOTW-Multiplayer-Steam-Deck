# Project on Hold
This project is an installer script for the Breath of the Wild Multiplayer mod on Linux systems such as the Steam Deck. This project it currently on hold because the mod's downloads and support have been temporarily suspended. We will work on the project more once the mod is back! 

Despite this, the installer is in a working state (though is very early and could have scary bugs!) If you would like to try to get it working, see [#40](https://github.com/L1Z3/BOTW-Multiplayer-Steam-Deck/issues/40).
